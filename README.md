# Python String Utilities and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains two distinct Python projects: a collection of string manipulation utilities (`Challenge.py`) and a simple sentiment analysis tool (`sentiment_analysis.py`). Both projects are independent and showcase different functionalities.

## Projects Overview

### 1. String Manipulation Utilities (`Challenge.py`)

This project provides a set of functions for prefix and suffix manipulations and word transformation based on linguistic rules.

#### Features:
- Add the prefix 'un' to a given word.
- Create new words with a common prefix.
- Remove the suffix 'ness' and make necessary adjustments to the remaining word.
- Transform adjectives into verbs within a given sentence context.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis Tool (`sentiment_analysis.py`)

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of text data, particularly focused on product reviews.

#### Features:
- Preprocess and clean text data.
- Analyze the polarity and subjectivity of sentences using TextBlob.
- Sample and test sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon product reviews.
